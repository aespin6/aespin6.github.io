    <p>I really like the homepage of this site. It's a giant circular navigation system, which features other sites. I really want to incorporate that hover over feature to my on site. I'm guessing it's also some type of animation. Same when you click on a work. There's this transition that I want to learn how to do for some aspects of my site.</p>
