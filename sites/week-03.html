    <p>I really like this site, a lot of my eariler designs borrowed this layout. I like the subtle animation on the navigation links, and the pop up menu on the pieces. Some works have this slide show feature. Those two things are what I want to learn how to do for future projects. And just how the image in contained in it's space.</p>
